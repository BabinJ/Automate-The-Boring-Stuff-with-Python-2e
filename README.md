### Automate The Boring Stuff with Python (2nd Edition) - A Python Semi-Noobie's Workthrough

In this repository, I will be working through the entire "Automate the Boring St#uff with Python (2e)" text by the incredible @alsweigart .

![Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/images/cover_automate2_thumb.jpg)

Far from being another run-of-the-mill, "here's your syntax, now build the Taj Mahal" Python book, Sweigart has focused the book around constructing functioning, **useful** projects. This takes one from simply seeing what a for-loop is, to actually using them in a practical way. If that weren't enough, the book is offered for free through [Sweigart's website](https://inventwithpython.com/). If you're strapped for cash and want to learn, this is an amazing resource that he has made for the community. If, however, you can spare the cash, then you should definitely consider supporting its creator by buying a physical copy.

Directories will be created for chapters/projects/exercises where code reproduction and/or creation will occur (straightforward one/two-liner examples in the text will not be copied....this isn't LPTHW).

Ancillary skills will be folded into this project (starting at various times), including:
-Git+Github
-github-cli
-Expanded use of the terminal
-Larger projects (if applicable) may be broken into multiple files/folders

The goal is to complete the entire text, including all projects, within three (3) months of repository inception.
