In this repository, I will be working through the entire "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (2e)" text by @alsweigart .

Directories will be created for chapters/projects/exercises where coding/reproduction will occur (rather than simple one/two-liner examples in the text).

The goal is to complete the text within three (3) months of repository inception.
